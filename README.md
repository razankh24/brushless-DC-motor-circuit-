# brushless-DC-motor-circuit-

in this project I designed schematic for controlling brushless DC motors (BLDC) using QS-909 JYQD driver and arduino

controlling its speed and direction. 

# about brushless DC motors 

 "brushless DC electric motor (BLDC motor or BL motor), also known as an electronically commutated motor (ECM or EC motor) or synchronous DC motor,it's a motor using a direct 
 
 current (DC) electric power supply. It uses an electronic closed loop controller to switch DC currents to the motor windings producing magnetic fields which effectively 
 
 rotate in space and which the permanent magnet rotor follows. The controller adjusts the phase and amplitude of the DC current pulses to control the speed and torque
 
 of the motor. This control system is an alternative to the mechanical commutator (brushes) used in many conventional electric motors."

# code 

I upload the code with basic instruction controlled by arduino to change the speed and direction as desired. 

# how can we upgrade the project? 

we can include 3 hall sensor,  Typically, the three Hall Effect Sensors are placed 120 degree apart from each other, giving 0 to 360 degree angle position

 once a Hall effect sensor detects that it is now in a magnetic field, it is able to sense the position of objects.
